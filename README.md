# ERP Newsletter Automation — AM2

Semi-automation of the weekly ESRC Education Research Programme newsletter. The newsletter has been manually curated since July 2023 by two team members who spend approximately 7 hours per week scanning ~55 sources, assigning articles to sections, deduplicating, and writing editorial descriptions.

This project builds a pipeline to handle the administrative sorting — gathering, classifying, and deduplicating — so the curators focus on editorial judgement.

---

## What this builds

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Section classifier** | Given an article title, predicts which of 6 newsletter sections it belongs in |
| **Semantic deduplication** | Groups articles from different sources covering the same story |
| **Newsletter draft** *(stretch)* | Generates a structured draft from classified + deduplicated articles |

Five models are trained and compared for the classifier — from a TF-IDF baseline to fine-tuned transformers to LLM-based zero/few-shot classification. See [docs/project_plan.md](docs/project_plan.md).

## Newsletter sections

| Section | Label |
|---|---|
| Teacher recruitment, retention & development | `teacher_workforce` |
| EdTech | `edtech` |
| Political environment and key organisations | `political_environment` |
| Four Nations | `four_nations` |
| Research – Practice – Policy | `research_practice_policy` |
| What matters in education? | `what_matters` |

*Update from Programme* and *Update from PI* are internal sections — always manually written, not classified by the model.
